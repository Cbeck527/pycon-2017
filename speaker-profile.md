##### Biography

I’m currently an Infrastructure Engineer at Warby Parker.

After finishing my undergraduate degree at Syracuse University in 2013 I moved
to New York City to start my career in technology. Currently I’m a member of a
one person team that manages the developer infrastructure, cloud instances, and
development tooling at Warby Parker. I enjoy working on passionate teams and
breathing life into wacky ideas. I love to combine technical and creative minds
to see what can be built.
